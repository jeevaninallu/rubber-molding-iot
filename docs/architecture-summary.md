This project implements a cloud-native, serverless pipeline for simulated IoT telemetry from hydraulic rubber molding machines. Telemetry is produced by a local simulator and ingested via MQTT or HTTP into a managed ingestion layer, streamed through a message service (Kinesis / Pub/Sub / Event Hubs), processed by serverless functions to compute features and enrich events, persisted in a time-series database for fast queries and a data lake for raw storage, and consumed by ML services for anomaly detection and predictive maintenance. A React-based frontend and Grafana dashboards provide operator views while a FastAPI backend exposes secure REST APIs for telemetry, alerts and model predictions.
